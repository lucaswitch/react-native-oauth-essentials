# About

**React Native OAuth Essentials** is an essential OAuth solution for React Native apps. It provides **up-to-date Google
Sign-In, Apple Sign-In, and Password Sign-In**, delivering a **native sign-in experience** with a simple, promise-based
API. It's a must-have for every React Native app.

## How to use it

[Usage](./usage)

## Short history

I’ve always felt that React Native lacked a single library that handles OAuth end-to-end. Most React Native apps end up
downloading multiple libraries just to implement OAuth features. Each library feels different—they follow different
philosophies, have different implementations, and some are outdated.

Coming from native development, I wanted a library that provides all the OAuth features an app actually needs. That’s
why I created and launched it as “Essentials.” One big reason is that if you include Google OAuth in your app, Apple’s
App Store policies require you to provide Apple OAuth as well, or your app won’t be approved.

I was frustrated going through this process myself, and seeing how much time React Native developers spent trying to
deliver a “good enough” sign-in experience. So I thought—why not create one library that actually behaves and doesn’t
make me want to throw my laptop out the window?

## Philosophy

Free forever, up-to-date features, and focused only on the essentials your mobile app really needs.
